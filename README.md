## Project Overview
The project, developed in `main.ipynb`, presents a systematic approach to handling and analyzing data. It involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing insights through plots and charts
- Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models
- Comparing model performance to derive optimal solutions

## Features
- Comprehensive EDA with visual insights
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Model training using algorithms from Scikit-learn
- Evaluation metrics for classification/regression performance
- Reproducible workflow with Jupyter Notebook

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn  

## Installation
To set up the environment, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn


## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells:

jupyter notebook main.ipynb


Run analyses, visualize insights, and experiment with various models.
